# k-mean-clustering
Applying k-mean clustering on a dataset using R.
You are required to apply k-mean clustering on the dataset. You have to go through these steps.
•	Import dataset
    o	You need to understand this dataset and know what it needs to be clustered.
    o	Extract your features from the data.
    o	Make estimation about what you need to cluster and what these data tells you how samples do you have etc. 
•	Pre-processing
    o	Your dataset needs to be ready for the training step. So you need to filter your necessary information.
    o	Normalizing your data is necessary in this step. (if you have picked up a data that is already normalized then you will get this step points)
•	Training the model
    o	What is your suitable k according to your problem?
•	Evaluate your model
    o	What are your clusters and their centres?
    o	What is your error function? Manhattan distance or Euclidian distance 
    o	Plot your clusters
    o	Justify what is the meaning of these clusters according to your problem?
